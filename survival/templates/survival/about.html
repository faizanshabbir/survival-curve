                    <p>The Kaplan Meier Survival Curve provides an accurate visual representation of patient population survival over a specific period of time.  In a standard survival curve, each step in the graph represents the loss of a percentage of the population at a specific time point.  Survival curves have many uses which include: the comparison of a prospective treatment in patients and the comparison between patient populations of different diseases/disease types.  For more on survival curves, please watch: </p>
                    
                    <p>Survival curves were previously generated using complex calculations followed by plotting points on a graph.  Alternatives to manual plotting have been recently developed but are hard to use for the researcher, lack aesthetic appeal, and require the purchase of expensive software bundles.  To address this need for researchers, a team of scientists and programmers at HippoGen have designed an easy-to-use software for generating survival curves from multiple data sets. These curves can be customized and downloaded in a high-quality vector format for use in publications and presentations. We encourage you to give it a try (link to curve), let us know what you think (link to survey), and share with your fellow researchers (link to Facebook or something else). Happy Curving!</p>
