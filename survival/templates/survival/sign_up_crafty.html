			<h2>Meet Bob.</h2>
			<p>Bob loves his job as a biomedical researcher. To move forward, Bob needs to show his work and progress to the academic and medical community.  Bob needs to generate a survival curve, but it takes him hours to do so!  Other solutions cost him hundreds of dollars.  With 7 conferences a year, and monthly presentations, Bob is generating almost 20 survival curves: each one taking him 3 hours.  Then Bob discovered KM Survival.  Now, it only takes him minutes to generate a survival curve.  It's as simple as typing in the data, clicking a button, and he has high quality, vectorized, publishable surivival curve graphs ready to go.  With so much time saved, Bob now has more time to focus on science!</p>
